# betterdiscord-showhiddenchannels
Recently, as of September 5, 2022, the betterdiscord plugin known as ShowHiddenChannels was removed from the BetterDiscord site, and a forced update completely broke it ([new plugin shows this screen](https://github.com/MrDiamond64/image-assets/raw/main/showhiddenchannels.png)). Some people, such as me, have perserved an old version for archival purposes.

# Notice when using an old version of ShowHiddenChannels
If you try to use an old version, a forced update will automatically update it. To get around this, open ShowHiddenChannels.plugin.js and set the version number to 9.9.9
